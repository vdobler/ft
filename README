This project shall provide reliable, easy to use and fast methods and tools 
to check websites and webinterfaces.

Web test suites can be set up and run. A test can set header information
to send to the server and check the response: Returned header values and
the body. To facilliate tests for tags a tag-language allows to find/count
tags matching certain conditions.

webtest itself needs to packages: tag and suite which might be usefull
as standalone packages.

This project shall provide reliable, easy to use and fast methods and tools 
to check websites and webinterfaces.

It currently implements tag to check the presence of tags and tag-structures
in html/xml documents.

Web test suites can be set up and run. A test can set header information
to send to the server and check the response: Returned header values and
the body (by use of above tag, text and binary matching)

Next steps:
 - parser to read tests and whole test suites from file
 - tag counting
 - local unit test
